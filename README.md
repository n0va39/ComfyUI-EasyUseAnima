# ComfyUI EasyUse Anima

Small ComfyUI custom node pack for NAIA/Anima workflows.

This package is independent from `comfyui-naia-bridge`. It does not import or
override that node pack, so both can be installed at the same time.

Reference baseline:

- `DNT-LAB/comfyui-naia-bridge` master `b82f98e`
- NAIA API endpoints used:
  - `POST /api/comfyui/random`
  - `peng_override` request field

## Nodes

### EasyUse Anima NAIA Random Prompt

Category: `EasyUse/Anima/NAIA`

Outputs:

- `prompt`
- `negative_prompt`
- `width`
- `height`

Main controls:

- `use_naia_bridge=false`: bypass NAIA and return input `prompt`,
  `negative_prompt`, `width`, `height` as-is. If the inputs are unchanged,
  this mode does not break ComfyUI caching.
- `freeze_naia_output=true`: if cached output is valid, return it without
  calling NAIA. This keeps downstream cache stable for the same fixed output.
- Saved-image workflow reproduction: after a fresh NAIA response, saved image
  metadata is written with `freeze_naia_output=true` and cached output values.
  Loading that workflow reproduces the same output without another NAIA call.
- `use_naia_settings=false`: send this node's `pre_prompt`, `post_prompt`,
  `auto_hide`, and preprocessing options to NAIA for this request.

The `remove_*` preprocessing options are marked as advanced inputs.

## Requirements

NAIA must expose the ComfyUI remote API used by `comfyui-naia-bridge`.

Install Python dependency:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

ComfyUI restart is required after installing or updating this node pack.
